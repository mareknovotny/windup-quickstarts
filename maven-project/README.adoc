== What is it?

The Seam Asynchronous annotation is not compatible with remote EJBs in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and must be replaced with the Java EE 6 @Asynchronous annotation.

This quickstart emphasizes using Windup in Maven project directly to create reports for migration to Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6. 

This quickstart enhances core Windup rules with its own custom Windup rules file using XML format.
